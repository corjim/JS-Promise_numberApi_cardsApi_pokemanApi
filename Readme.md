# JavaScript Promise

### Asynchronous Code

- Three APIs were explored using the asynchronous callbacks.

- Random numbers were chosen to get the meaning or text using axios request.

- With the same AJAX method, decks of cards were drawn and display at random over repetive API calls and the pattern of how this callback is made was displayed.

- Lastly the same method was used to explore and display the names and urls of pokeman.
